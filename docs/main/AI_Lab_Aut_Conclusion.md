In this lab, you successfully explored the capabilities of the Webex Autonomous Agent by creating and configuring a virtual agent to assist a flower shop. The virtual agent was designed to recommend suitable flowers based on the customer's occasion and calculate the total price. Additionally, you configured actions to integrate with a third-party application, enabling the virtual agent to generate orders and provide customers with an order number in real time. Finally, you configured the virtual agent to send order confirmation details to customers via SMS, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience.


This hands-on exercise demonstrated how Webex Autonomous Agent can streamline business processes, enhance customer interactions, and integrate with external systems to deliver a comprehensive solution.
