# Mission  Integrating the AI Agent with Flow for Voice Calls

## Mission overview
Your mission is to:

Integrate the AI Agent with the Voice Flow. 

### Task 1. Build WxCC voice flow with AI Agent.

1. In Control Hub navigate to **Flows**, click on **Manage Flows** dropdown list and select **Create Flows**

2. Select Start Fresh and name the new flow **<span class="attendee-id-container">AutonomousAI_Flow_<span class="attendee-id-placeholder" data-prefix="AutonomousAI_Flow_">Your_Attendee_ID</span><span class="copy" title="Click to copy!"></span></span>**

3. Make sure the **Edit** mode at the top is set to **ON**. Then, drag and drop the **Virtual Agent V2** and **DisconnectContact** activities from the left panel onto the canvas.

    !!! Note
        Please make sure to use **VirtualAgentV2** activity and <span style="color: red;">**NOT**</span> **VirtualAgent** also present on the Activity Library for Backward Compatability.

    > Connect the **New Phone Contact** output node edge to this **VirtualAgentV2** node
    >
    > Connect the Handled outputs to **DisconnectContact** 
    >
    > Connect the Errored outputs to **DisconnectContact** 
    >
    > Set **Static Contact Center AI Config**
    >
    > Contact Center AI Config: **Webex AI Agent (Autonomous)**
    >
    > Virtual Agent: **<span class="attendee-id-container"><span class="attendee-id-placeholder" data-suffix="_AutoAI_Lab">Your_Attendee_ID</span>_AutoAI_Lab<span class="copy" title="Click to copy!"></span></span>**

4. Drag and drop following nodes:

    - **Queue Contact** activity onto the Flow from the left side panel

      >
      > Connect the **Escalated** path from the **Virtual Agent V2** activity to the **Queue Contact** activity.
      >
      > Connect the **Queue Contact** activity to the **Play Music** activity
      >
      > Connect the **Failure** path from the **Queue Contact** activity to the **Disconnect Contact** activity.
      > 
      > Select **Static Queue**
      > 
      > Queue name: **<span class="attendee-id-container"><span class="attendee-id-placeholder" data-suffix="_Queue">Your_Attendee_ID</span>_Queue<span class="copy" title="Click to copy!"></span></span>**
      > 

    - **Play Music**

      >
      > Create a loop by connecting the Play Music activity back to itself - to create a music loop, following the diagram provided.
      >
      > Connect the **Failure** path from the **Play Music** activity to the **Disconnect Contact** activity.
      > 
      > Music File: **defaultmusic_on_hold.wav**

6. Assign the Flow to your **Channel (Entry Point)** - Do this by first going to **Channel** > Search for your channel **<span class="attendee-id-placeholder">Your_Attendee_ID</span>_Channel**.
7. Click on **<span class="attendee-id-placeholder">Your_Attendee_ID</span>_Channel**
8. In **Entry Point** Settings section change the following:

    > Routing Flow: **<span class="attendee-id-container">AutonomousAI_Flow_<span class="attendee-id-placeholder" data-prefix="AutonomousAI_Flow_">Your_Attendee_ID</span><span class="copy" title="Click to copy!"></span></span>**

    > Version Label: **Latest**

    ![Profiles](../graphics/Lab1/L1M7_AutonomousAI_FlowtoEP.gif)  

9. Dial Support Number assigned to your **<span class="attendee-id-placeholder">Your_Attendee_ID</span>_Channel** to test the Autonomous Virtual Agent over a voice call.


### Task 2. Test the AI Agent integration with voice flow.

1. Your Agent desktop session should be still active but if not, use Webex CC Desktop application ![profiles](../graphics/overview/Desktop_Icon40x40.png) and login with agent credentials you have been provided **<span class="attendee-id-container">wxcclabs+agent_ID<span class="attendee-id-placeholder" data-prefix="wxcclabs+agent_ID" data-suffix="@gmail.com">Your_Attendee_ID</span>@gmail.com<span class="copy" title="Click to copy!"></span></span>**. You will see another login screen with OKTA on it where you may need to enter the email address again and the password provided to you. 
2. Select Team **<span class="attendee-id-container"><span class="attendee-id-placeholder" data-suffix="_Team">Your_Attendee_ID</span>_Team<span class="copy" title="Click to copy!"></span></span>**. Click **Submit**. Allow browser to access Microphone by clicking **Allow** on every visit.
3. Make your agent ***Available*** and you're ready to make a call.
