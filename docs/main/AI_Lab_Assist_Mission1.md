## Feature Description

Agent Transfer Summary enhances agent efficiency and elevate customer experiences.

When a customer calls the contact center and interacts with a Virtual Agent (VA), they may request to speak with a live agent at some point during the conversation. Once connected to an agent, it is important for the agent to receive a concise summary of the customer's interaction with the VA. This summary provides the agent with a quick overview of the customer's call reason. The "Virtual Agent Handoff Summary" feature provides this summary, displaying it on the agent's desktop within the AI-Assistant Widget.

## Mission Details

Your mission is to:

1. Configure a smoth handoff to live human agent from AI Agent.
2. Modify Virtual Agent transcript
3. Configure routing based on last used intent
4. Use AI Assistant
